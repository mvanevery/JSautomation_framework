## Commit, Pull, Push and Peer Review

### Commit

- The best time to Commit your code is any time you feel you've done a
significant amount of work.
- To push your code, you can go VCS on the menu, drop down to Git and select Push
under the Fetch command. This will push your code to branch locally but will not
commit the code to your branch on the server.
### Push
- Typically you push your code at the same time that you push code. That is to ensure
 that the code in the repo matches the code you have locally on your machine.
### Pull
- You pull to your branch when you have done development on a different machine and
need to update. You also pull to your branch when you are about to submit for code for
a PR (peer review/pull request).
### Peer Review/Pull Request
- When you have code that you feel is ready to be merged into the development branch or want
 to open it up for collaboration you do this through a PR (peer review/pull request). This is
 done within BitBucket, in the repo for the project.
