# Commit, Pull, Commit and Peer Review

## Push

- The best time to Push and Commit your code is any time you feel you've done a
significant amount of work.
- To push your code, you can go VCS on the menu, drop down to Git and select Push
under the Fetch command. This will push your code to branch locally but will not
commit the code to your branch on the server.
## Pull
- You pull to your branch when you have done development on a different machine and
need to update. You also pull to your branch when you are about to submit for code for
Peer Review.
